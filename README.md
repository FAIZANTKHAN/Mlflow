# MLOps Basic Repository

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for implementing basic Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) principles. It includes various tools and methods for model deployment, version control, and CI/CD pipelines, with examples and use cases in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and Python. We also utilize DagsHub for tracking experiments, datasets, and collaboration in ML projects.

## Applications

This repository covers the following MLOps applications:
1. **Model Versioning**: Keeping track of different versions of machine learning models.
2. **Data Versioning**: Handling datasets efficiently across versions.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines for ML**: Continuous integration and delivery for machine learning models.
4. **Experiment Tracking**: Tracking hyperparameters, results, and metrics from experiments.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploying models to various platforms (cloud, local).
6. **Monitoring Models in Production**: Ensuring models are performing as expected post-deployment.
7. **DagsHub Integration**: Versioning datasets, models, and collaboration using DagsHub.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Git

### Steps to Install

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlops-basic.git
   cd mlops-basic
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/MacOS
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install DagsHub CLI:
   ```bash
   pip install dagshub
   ```

## Running on Different Platforms

### Running on Jupyter Notebook

To run the MLOps workflows on Jupyter Notebook:
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the notebook folder and open any `.ipynb` file. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run MLOps pipelines.

### Running on Google Colab

You can also run the notebooks in Google Colab:
1. Open Google Colab and upload the `.ipynb` files from the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Ensure the required libraries are installed by running:
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running with Python

For running scripts directly with Python, use:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```
or other relevant scripts inside the `scripts/` folder. Modify the configurations inside the script or pass arguments through the command line.

### Running with DagsHub

DagsHub is integrated to track models, datasets, and experiments:
1. Initialize DagsHub inside the project:
   ```bash
   dagshub init
   ```
2. Push model and dataset versions:
   ```bash
   dagshub push --model models/model_v1.pkl --dataset datasets/data_v1.csv
   ```
3. View experiment results and collaborate via DagsHubâ€™s web UI.

## Functionalities and Use Cases

### 1. **Model Versioning**
   - Track and manage different versions of ML models.
   - Use case: Comparing performance between models with different architectures.

### 2. **Data Versioning**
   - Keep track of the datasets used across different stages of the ML pipeline.
   - Use case: Handling changes in data distributions or feature engineering changes.

### 3. **CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Automate training, validation, and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
   - Use case: Ensuring reproducibility of experiments across environments.

### 4. **Experiment Tracking**
   - Automatically track experiments using libraries like `mlflow` or `wandb`.
   - Use case: Tracking hyperparameters, metrics, and model artifacts.

### 5. **Model Deployment**
   - Deploy models to platforms like AWS, GCP, or serve them via Flask/Django.
   - Use case: Scaling model inference in production.

### 6. **Monitoring Models**
   - Integrate monitoring tools to check the performance of models in production.
   - Use case: Detecting model drift or data distribution changes.

### 7. **DagsHub Integration**
   - Use DagsHub for versioning datasets, models, and experiment tracking.
   - Use case: Collaborative machine learning workflows across teams.

## DagsHub Integration

DagsHub is integrated into this repository for:
- Dataset versioning.
- Model versioning.
- Tracking experiments and hyperparameters.
- Collaborative work with visualized progress.

To start using DagsHub, create an account at [dagshub.com](https://dagshub.com) and follow the steps in the installation section to push models and datasets.

### Pushing Data and Models to DagsHub

To push data and models to DagsHub, first link your repository by running:
```bash
dagshub connect <repository_url>
```

Then, push your model and datasets with the following command:
```bash
dagshub push --model <model_path> --dataset <dataset_path>
```
